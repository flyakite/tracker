Hi there!

Thanks for joining zenblip for recruiters.

Ever send out an email to a great candidate but got no response? Yeah, me too.

As you are now getting started, we thought this would be a good opportunity to make sure you know all the details of what zenblip can do for you as a recruiter, and where to get help if you ever need it.

Zenblip will help you know….
1. what time your emails have been received
2. if they have been read or not
3. what location it is being read
4. what device it is being read on
5. how many times it has been read
6. if your links are being clicked on

And help you on your way to finding out invaluable insights about your candidates and clients…So you can know them better than your competitors and increase your bottom line.

If you are not sure about anything, have some feedback and comments or would just like to have a question answered, feel free to reach out to us anytime, anywhere.

Cheers,

The zenblip team
