Hi There!

As you are now starting to get the hang of things, have you remembered to check out and customize your zenblip user settings?

You can do this by accessing your zenblip dashboard. Click on the zenblip logo in your email tool bar (you will then be directed to the dashboard) > click on ‘Settings’ > click on the appropriate email account and away you go.

Hope this helps and makes zenblip even better for you and your needs.

Cheers and have fun,

The zenblip team
