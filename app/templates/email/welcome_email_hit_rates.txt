Hi There!

OK...right...so you have zenblip up and running but are you actually getting the full use out of it? Did you know that:

1. Using the reminder function can actually increase your follow up rate by 30%
2. The template function can reduce your average email time by 1.25 hours everyday!
3. Email templates enable you to gain valuable insights to your email response rates...and can increase your hit rate by up to 50%

Simple as 1, 2, 3...But actually doing it is another thing. So jump on now and get those email templates set up and give the reminder tool a try.

Cheers and have fun,

The zenblip team
